IMPORTANT NOTES

THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE.

Some testing has been done, and I'm sure there are bugs left.

As for additional features:  tell me what you want...

The Business::UPC pod section is the main documentation.

The documentation is only a draft and should be rewritten (I think).
Any help on this issue would be very welcome.

DESCRIPTION

This is the alpha release 0.01 of the Business::UPC parser generator.

REQUIREMENTS

Requires perl5.004 or better.  Maybe it'll work with older versions.
Maybe not.

It is written only in Perl, with standard distribution modules, so you
don't need any compiler nor special modules.

INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

WARRANTY

This software comes with absolutly NO WARRANTY of any kind.
I just hope it can be useful.
